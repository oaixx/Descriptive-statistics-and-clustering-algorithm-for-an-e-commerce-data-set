In-depth Mining of E-commerce User Behavior Based on Clustering and Statistical Testing

This project aims to explore and analyze e-commerce user behavior using clustering algorithms and various statistical testing methods. The goal is to extract valuable insights from user data that can inform marketing strategies, customer segmentation, and product recommendations.

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of e-commerce user behavior. It begins with data preprocessing, where the dataset is loaded, cleaned, and prepared for analysis by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.  

Following the initial data preparation, the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model is implemented to segment users based on their purchasing behavior. This model categorizes users into different segments such as "Champions," "Loyal Customers," and "At Risk," providing a foundational understanding of user groups.

Building on the RFM model, K-Means clustering is applied to further segment users. This involves standardizing numerical features and determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method and Silhouette score. Each cluster's characteristics are then analyzed to gain deeper insights into the distinct user segments.

In addition to clustering, various statistical tests, including ANOVA, Chi-Square, and Point Biserial Correlation, are used to explore relationships between different variables. These tests help identify significant correlations and patterns, which are visualized through heatmaps and other graphical representations.

Finally, the insights generated from both clustering and statistical analysis are synthesized to provide actionable recommendations. These insights can inform marketing strategies tailored to the different user segments identified in the analysis.
